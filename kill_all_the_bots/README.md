#### How to kill all the bots

Use the `follower_scraper.py` file to get all the followers for a particular account (I guess there's a better way for doing this but I wanted to do it using the Twitter API). You need [Twurl](https://github.com/twitter/twurl) available and authenticated to be able to run the scraper successfully.

The `find_all_the_bots.R` script was used to generate a simple plot and find all the accounts that fulfill the conditions that are described in [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/elgatoninja/status/1025358089598455810).
